# RadioInterface
This project will hold the Radio interface PCB design. (mostel Radio amteurs will use this)<br>
This is a PCB that will alowe a USB and Mic / line in and External speaker output of laptop or computer to most Amateur radios.<br>
1) PTT isolation and control vith USB RTS.<br>
2) Isolation of Audio in and out of radio. <br>
3) Possible Cat control via serial interface. (Yaesu Ft 857 and others to follow)<br>
4) Most components will be SMD components to reduce assembly cost and production automation.
<br>
##Possible usage
1) APRS<br>
2) AFSK<br>
3) PSK .... digital modes<br>
4) Satellite beacon decoding.<br>
5 ... <br>
